# PCs
Player characters are a news team for a small news corp, Night City News, or N'C'N, reporting on crime. The team works out from a news van that holds all the gear needed for a broadcast (via the corp HQ). Following leads and checking out reports take them everywhere in Night City to get the scoop.

## To bring the news, you must first get the news!
*So look, this is how it works. Media is the face of the team, and delivers the stories. Someone needs to know enough tech and electronics to make sure the story is recorded and delivered. Investigator finds leads and coordinates the team. Anyone with information needs to get persuaded, bribed, threatened, coerced, seduced or otherwise conviced to part with that information.  Security is there to make sure no trouble starts, and to bully the information out of people who refuse to otherwise co-operate. Simple.* - Dana 'Just Do It' Schroder, senior producer, 54 News

Co-operate to build the characters into a functional news team. This is not a combat team, and strolling into a potential news scene in combat gear (highly visible weaponry, heavy armor) is not going to get you any information. There is going to be a need for guns and combat, but it's not the default. A team must have one Media, at least one Investigator (Cop, Fixer), at least one Support (Techie, Medtechie) and at least one Security (Solo, Nomad) class. Every character should also have the means to obtain leads and information to build the news in addition to their own occupation.

## Character Creation Instructions and Limitations
None of the characters are legends, but all are capable. The character creation process reflects this. Media is mandatory, other classes are optional (and few entirely barred.) Players may pick classes as they jointly decide. The Media is mission critical, and will hopefully be there at nearly every session. Others can be covered for by NPC support in a pinch.

- Stats and career skills are pre-set, but learned skills (i.e. all non-career, non-class specific skills) are up to players to decide. Each character has 15 points to spend, however the maximum skill rank for learned skills is 4.
- Cyberware: Each character has extra 10 points of humanity to use for cyberware before having to pay from empathy.
- Gear: Extremely common (E) and Common (C) gear only. One item or upgrade can break this rule with GM's approval. 
- Slight changes in stats or skills are possible on request supported by character history. (E.g. change martial arts type, or move a point from Cool to Attr.)
- Reputation is adjustable (about range 0-3).
- Each character needs to fulfill their class specific requirements (see below).
